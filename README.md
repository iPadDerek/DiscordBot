# DiscordBot

Just a fun side project to learn some Node.js and make a useful tool for some friends on Discord. Lets users read and write values to an FGO Damage Calulator (or really any spreadsheet) on Google Sheets. 

Kinda outdated, but whatever ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Requires Node.js

Includes Discord.js and GoogleAPIs

If you really want to use it yourself, you'll have to:

Create your own bot profile on Discord and find the original FGO Calculator V1.33 floating around somewhere,

Create your own spreadsheet.json and secret_token.json files with the spreadsheet id and bot login token respectively,

Invite the bot to your server and change the channel IDs in the code to match the channels you want the bot to have access to.
